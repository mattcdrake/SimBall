# Game Loop Algorithm

Assume that all initializations have taken place and we don't have to worry
about game state clean up, menus, or player substitutions (for now) etc.

set batter
while (strikes < 3 && balls < 4 && !hit):
    deliver pitch
    if (hit && fair):
        run play
    else:
        adjust pitch count
if (balls == 4):
    walk
else:
    strikeout
